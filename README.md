# mcp-playwright-pytest-agent

**mcp-playwright-pytest-agent** is an experimental project that combines **Playwright** for browser automation, **Pytest** for structured testing, and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for context-aware orchestration. It’s designed for developers who want to explore **next-gen automation** while learning and having fun.

---

## Why This Project?

- **Context switching** between tools and workflows  
- **Dynamic environments** with popups, MFA, and flaky UI elements  
- **Integrating AI-driven orchestration** into existing test ecosystems  

This project tries to leverage Playwright MCP to create **context-driven automation tests**

---

## Key Features

- ✅ **Playwright + Pytest Integration** – Combine modern browser automation with robust testing  
- ✅ **Custom Assertions** – Define domain-specific success conditions
- ✅ **Bring Your Own Tools** – Plug in custom Python functions   
- ✅ **Bring Your Own MCP Servers** – Connect to external MCP-based services for extended capabilities  
- ✅ **Async & Modular Design** – Flexible architecture for experimentation  

---

## Challenges & Learning Goals

- Implementing **self-healing automation** when elements change or fail  
- Managing **timeouts and retries** in unpredictable UI flows  
- Orchestrating **multi-step, context-aware scenarios** with MCP  
- Exploring **how AI agents can assist in real-world test automation**  

---

This is not just a tool—it’s a **sandbox for ideas**. Perfect for anyone curious about **AI-assisted testing**, **context-aware automation**, and **modern testing workflows**. Whether you’re experimenting with MCP, building custom tools, or integrating advanced orchestration into your tests, this project gives you a starting point to learn and innovate.
